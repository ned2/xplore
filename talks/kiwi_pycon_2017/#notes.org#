In my work, frequently need to make interfaces that:
 -- expose a model built in Python
 -- interactive
 -- sharable
 -- scalable (reasonably)
** man many many JavaScript options
(slide of JS logos) 
** problems
-- work involved in gluing Python into JavaScript
-- need to have familiarity with JavaScript
** the jungle of JavaScript toolchains
